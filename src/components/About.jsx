      <p className="">
        Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes
        and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
        development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
        building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
        corporation, and a digital product studio.
        <br />
        <br /> My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces
        for our customers at Klaviyo. I most enjoy building software in the
        sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but
        are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released
        an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build
        a web app with the Spotify API.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading,
        hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule
        searching for Korok seedsKorok seeds.
